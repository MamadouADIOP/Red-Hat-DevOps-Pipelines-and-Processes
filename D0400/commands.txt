Unpack the compressed archive file, and then copy the oc binary to a directory of your choice. Ensure that this directory is in the PATH variable for your system. On macOS and Linux, copy the oc binary to /usr/local/bin:
[user@host c~]$ sudo p oc /usr/local/bin/

[user@host ~]$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/oc
